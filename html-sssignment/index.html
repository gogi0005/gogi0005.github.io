            <p>I am a Graphic Designer from India, I consider myself a design geek! <br>
               I am also passionate in starting a design agency named <em>MERCURY Designs</em>.
            </p>
            <p>I started my journey as a graphic designer in 2017. <br>
                 This keen interest towards design was further developed during the pandemic. <br>
                 I set about to focus all my attention on learning everything about Graphic design <br>
                  and also worked as a freelance designer for the past three years</p>
