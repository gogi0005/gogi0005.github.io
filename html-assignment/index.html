            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
               I am a Graphic Designer from India, I consider myself a design geek! <br>
               I am also passionate in starting a design agency named <em>MERCURY Designs</em>.<br> 
               I started my journey as a graphic designer in 2017.<br>
               This keen interest towards design was further developed during the pandemic. <br>
               I set about to focus all my attention on learning everything about Graphic design <br>
               and also worked as a freelance designer for the past three years.

                 i try to explore these concepts as much has possible. Apart from those things <br>
                 I am serious tech savvy and I mean really serious tech savvy like I would have info <br>
                 about all the technologies being worked on by major tech companies like Samsung, Apple, Intel etc. <br>
                 Some of my future plans include building a clothing brand <br>
                 that has an emphasis on streetwear or comfort wear, also if possiblei would like to open a store at <abbr title="New York">NY's</abbr> famous Fifth Avenue. <br>
